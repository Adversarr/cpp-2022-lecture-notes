## About the computer...

> Recommendations: [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)

When programming, you can imagine the computer as:

1. A smart brain for operations/computing (i.e. Processor), but with no memory, e.g.
   - Calculate the result of `1 + 2`
   - Read some number from the terminal
   - ...
2. A scratch paper (i.e. Memory) to store your result, e.g.
   - Decalre a variable `int x;`, then the computer will allocate a space in the memory to store the value of variable `x`.
   - Calculate `x + y`, the computer will compute the value of `x + y`, store the *intermediate result* in memory. (actually you used the memory)
   - Perform `z = x`, the computer will *copy* the value of `z` to the value of `x`.

**Notes about variable**: When you decalre `int x;`, the `x` itself is just an `Identifier` just as we talked about in the lecture. Just imagine what you do in mathematics:

$$
\mathrm{let}~~ x = 1
$$

the variable $x$ here is just an identifier, the value of `x` is what we need actually.

Now you can take out a pen and a paper, and do like this (in sequential):

1. For all variables decalred, allocate some space for each of them to store their value, the order does not matter
2. For all operations performed, do the same operation on your paper.

For example:

```cpp
int main() 
{
  // allocate some space for x, current value = 1
  int x = 1; /* Current Paper: [x = 1] */
  int y = 2; /* Current Paper: [x = 1] [y = 2]*/
  int z = 2; /* Current Paper: [x = 1] [y = 2] [z = 2] */
  
  // Update the value of z to x + y insteade of the original...
  z = x + y; /* Current Paper: [x = 1] [y = 2] [y = 3]*/

  ...
}

```

## Basic Types

In the last section, when we talk about variables, we do not talk about how we store the values. As we know, computer use bits for storaging to **represent all kinds of values**.

### TL; DR

If you do not have much time, or you have already mastered Types, just read this subsection and go ahead.

1. use `int` / `long` for $i \in \mathbb Z$, diff in range
2. use `unsigned int`/ `unsigned long` for $n \in \mathbb N$, diff in range
3. use `float` / `double` for $\alpha \in \mathbb R$, diff in precision & range
4. use `char` for one character.

### Integers

The integers is the easiest case:

Take a list of 8 bits (0/1), the list can have $$2 ^ 8 = 256$$ different permuatations. then we can simply use each permutation to represent one integer, which ranges from 0 to 255 (256 numbers in total). *Unsigned* numbered are all constructed this way. 

```
00000000 => 0
00000001 => 1
00000010 => 2
...
11111111 => 256
```

The signed case is similar, but:

- the first bit stand for the sign of number,
- and complement is used for represent negative integers as we talked about in the lecture.

In C, we declare one variable using:

1. `int` -- 32 bits (4 bytes) in memory.
2. `long` -- 64bits (8 bytes) in memory.
3. `unsigned` -- for unsigned int / long numbers.

### Floatings.

IEEE.

### Chars

## Const Variables, Const Expressions

Each of the followings is const variables / const expressions? (now we talk about traditional c++, not the modern one)

1. `const int x;`
2. `3.1415926`
3. `1 + 2`
4. `"some text"`
5. let `const char x[] = "some text"`: `x` is ...?
