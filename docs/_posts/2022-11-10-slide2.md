# A Brief Introduction to Physics-based Computer Animation.

---

## ToC

1. What is Physics-based Computer Animation
2. How to simulate and visualize the world
3. What about your project

---

### What you will learn here

- Brief Introduction to CG: (mainly about simulation and geometry)
    - Geometry: Mesh, Particle
    - Simulation: Explicit and Semi-Implicit Methods
- "Advanced" C/C++ Programming Skills
    - How to use pointers
    - Objective Oriented Programming: class, virtual methods.
    - A scratch on meta-programming(templates)
- Usage of developing tools.
    - `git`, `xmake`, even Visual Studio
- ...

---

### What you will NOT learn

- Any confusing topic in CG. (e.g. MVP transformations, how to do rendering actually, GPU Programming, ...)
- Any advanced topic in C/C++ (e.g. meta-programming, user-maintained pointers, RAII)
- Real World Developing

---

### Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019~2022. (only for windows)
    - Clang Compiler is flavoured.
- xmake, VulkanSDK installed.

Note: vs2010 is not supported, we use C++ Standard 17.

## Introduction

---

### What is Physics-based Computer Animation

Simulate a world inside your computer.

---

### How do we represent Geometry Objects in Computer

1. Particle-based
2. Mesh-based

---

### Simulation = PDE

$$
\frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial t^2} = \sum_{i} F_i
$$

i.e.

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \sum_i F_i
$$

---

### Free Fall

$$
\sum_i F_i = Gravity
$$

---

### N-Body Simulation

$$
F_i = \text{Universal Gravity}
$$

---

### Cloth Simulation

$$
F = \sum_{n \in N(i)} F_n
$$

---

### Explicit Time Integration

Instead of $\partial t$, or $dt$, use $\delta t << 1$ to integrate all the physical variables over time.

Given $x_i$ at time $t_i$, compute $x_{i+1}$ as:
$$
x_{i+1} = x_{i} + \frac{dx}{dt} \delta t 
$$

> Semi-Implicit Scheme.

### Your work...

1. N-Body(Provided)
2. Particles with gravity
3. sand-simulation: based on (2), add basic collision detect and handling. (DEM)
4. pick one of the following:
    1. (Recommended) mass-spring cloth.
    3. SPH Fluid.
