### macOS: The provided template based on CMake

Your CMake project have the structure:

```sh
<task-root-folder>
|- include
   |- header1.h
   |- header2.cpp
|- source
   |- source1.cpp
   |- source2.cpp
   |- main.cpp
|- CMakeLists.txt
```

The `<task-root-folder>` is your workspace, and each **task** of one assignment should have seperate workspace(folder).

When handing on your assignment, 

**First**, put all the task in the folder `<MyAssignment>`:

```sh
<MyAssignment>
  <task1-root-folder>
  |- include
    |- header1.h
    |- header2.cpp
  |- source
    |- source1.cpp
    |- source2.cpp
    |- main.cpp
  |- CMakeLists.txt

  <task2-root-folder>
  |- include
    |- header1.h
    |- header2.cpp
  |- source
    |- source1.cpp
    |- source2.cpp
    |- main.cpp
  |- CMakeLists.txt

  <task3-root-folder>
  |- include
    |- header1.h
    |- header2.cpp
  |- source
    |- source1.cpp
    |- source2.cpp
    |- main.cpp
  |- CMakeLists.txt
```

**Then**, zip `<MyAssignment>` folder, and upload it to our system.
