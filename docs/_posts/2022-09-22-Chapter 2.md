## cin & cout

No comment is needed. The usage is simple!

Notes: always add `endl` or `'\n'` to your output.

Notes: formatted output is flavoured.

Caution: `\t` may be dangerous

Hard to use. In modern C++, we seldom use `iomanip`.

> Refer to the samples on [Input/Output Manipulation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip) when you use, and you are not required to remember all the usage/feature of each function.

### Why we say, input and output is *stream*

Stream is defined to be a sequence(typically, a sequence of `char`s), and you can only visit a stream through a position indicator.

```
... ... a b c ... ...
        ^
        the position indicator
```

use `cin >> a`, you extract some char at the position indicator and translate it into the type of a.

```
// input stream
... ... 123 b c ... ...
        ^
        the position indicator
```

```
int a; cin >> a; // read the position indicator, and set `a` to 123.
```

```
// input stream
... ... 123 b c ... ...
            ^
            the position indicator
```

use `cout << a`, you put some char at the position indicator.

```
// output stream
... ... 
        ^
        the position indicator
```


```
int a = 123; cout << a; // put a into output stream.
```

```
// output stream
... ... 123 
            ^
            the position indicator
```
